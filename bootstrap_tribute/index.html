        "I used to be embarrassed because I was just a comic-book writer while other people were building bridges or going on to medical careers.
        And then I began to realize: entertainment is one of the most important things in people’s lives. Without it they might go off the deep end.<br> I feel that if you’re able to entertain people, you’re doing a good thing."<br/>
